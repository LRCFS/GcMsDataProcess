# Detection and quantitation of novel benzodiazepines in tablets, powders, blotters and infused materials from Scottish prisons

A full xample of a calibration dataset and sample data are included. Other datasets can be included but should be run separately.  

The data collection was obtained on an Agilent instrument. The ".D" files needs to be converted using the ProteoWizard sofware to "*.ms1" files and placed in the appropriate folder. These files are then converted by the code. A metadata file describing the individual files is also required for final processing and for generating the output figure.
